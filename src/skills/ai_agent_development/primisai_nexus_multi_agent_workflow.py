Tutorial Skill: primisai-nexus-multi-agent-workflow

Domain: AI_AGENT_DEVELOPMENT
Version: 1.0.0
Complexity: High
Type: Tutorial
Category: Multi-Agent Systems

This skill encapsulates the knowledge and implementation patterns from the \"primisai nexus multi agent workflow\" tutorial. It provides a structured guide for building, configuring, and deploying mul

## Workflow
1. **Understand Requirements**: Analyze the target use case and determine which multi-agent systems patterns apply.
2. **Environment Setup**: Install required dependencies and configure the development environment.
3. **Core Implementation**: Follow the tutorial's step-by-step implementation to build the primary components.
4. **Integration**: Connect the implementation with existing systems and services.
5. **Testing & Validation**: Verify the implementation against expected outputs and edge ca

## Constraints
No constraints specified
